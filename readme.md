I realized one difference is sparisity of my data comparing to dmvg. maybe I can just focus on Imputation for multiomics if I could find more data and offer new way of adding noise (instead of adding noise from normal distribution. For sparse inputs, it may be beneficial to introduce noise in a way that accounts for sparsity, such as by adding noise only to the non-zero elements or by using different noise levels based on the data's density )

one other way is to find mlp or autoencoders techniques that get sparse input and predict data from normal distribution output
